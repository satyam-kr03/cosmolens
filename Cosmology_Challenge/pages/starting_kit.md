# Starting Kit and Sample Submission
***


## Phase 1: Cosmological Parameter Estimation
### Starting Kits
We have prepared three starting kits to help participants get started with the competition, to understand the data and prepare submissions for Codabench. You can check the starting kit notebooks on our GitHub repository or through the Google Colab below:

1. [<ins>**Power Spectrum Analysis**</ins>](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/Cosmology_Challenge/blob/master/Phase_1_Startingkit_WL_PSAnalysis.ipynb)

2. [<ins>**Convolutional Neural Network + MCMC**</ins>](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/Cosmology_Challenge/blob/master/Phase_1_Startingkit_WL_CNN_MCMC.ipynb)

3. [<ins>**Convolutional Neural Network Direct Prediction**</ins>](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/Cosmology_Challenge/blob/master/Phase_1_Startingkit_WL_CNN_Direct.ipynb)

#### ⚠️ Note:
- To run the starting kits locally on your device, please directly clone this repository. The `input_data` directory of this repository contains a downsampled dataset that allows you to run the starting kit with minimal efforts. 
- To run the CNN baseline methods locally on your device, please make sure that you have installed all required libraries and relevant dependencies. Fore more information, please check our [<ins>**conda instructions**</ins>](https://github.com/FAIR-Universe/Cosmology_Challenge/tree/master/conda).
- To fully train the baseline model and generate a dummy submission that can be scored on our competition website, you will need to download the public training data and the Phase 1 test data from the `Data` tab or from [**<ins>here</ins>**](https://www.codabench.org/datasets/download/c99c803a-450a-4e51-b5dc-133686258428/).



### Dummy Sample Submission
Dummy sample submission is provided to make you understand what is expected as a submission. The sample submission is a zip that only contains one json file named `result.json`. This file contains lists of `means` and `errorbars`. Each list has 4000 items and each item of these lists contains 2 values each. The format looks like this:

```json
{
    "means": [
        [
            2.1234,
            3.1456
        ],
        ... # total 4000 items
    ],
    "errorbars": [
        [
            0.1234,
            0.1456
        ],
        ... # total 4000 items
    ]
}
```

## Phase 2: Out-of-Distribution Detection
The starting kit of Phase 2 will be available when the Phase 2 starts.
